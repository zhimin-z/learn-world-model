## What this course covers

Five lectures and five projects that take you from the intuition behind world models to a working three-model evaluation dashboard.

| # | Type | Title | Core Topics |
|---|------|-------|-------------|
| L01 | Lecture | Internal Simulation & Historical Context | Craik's mental models, predictive coding, four eras of world model evolution |
| L02 | Lecture | Observation Encoding & Latent Dynamics | VAE, CNN encoder, ELBO, GRU → MDN-RNN → RSSM |
| L03 | Lecture | Architecture Patterns, Learning Paradigms & Planning | Six architecture families, CEM-MPC, latent Actor-Critic, TD-MPC |
| L04 | Lecture | Evaluation Metrics by World Model | FID, reward correlation, consistency loss, PSNR, horizon drift |
| L05 | Lecture | Frontier Debates | Language vs physical grounding, Bitter Lesson, AGI as a research target |
| P01 | Project | Train a VAE Encoder | Compress 64×64 pixels to latent z; reconstruction loss curve |
| P02 | Project | Build a Latent Dynamics Model | GRU → RSSM; 1-step vs 5-step prediction error |
| P03 | Project | Full Dreamer Pipeline | Encode → RSSM → latent Actor-Critic → act |
| P04 | Project | Implement TD-MPC Planning | CEM-MPC + latent consistency loss; compare vs Dreamer |
| P05 | Project | STORM + Three-Model Evaluation Dashboard | Swap GRU for Transformer; side-by-side Dreamer/TD-MPC/STORM dashboard |

You do not need to finish all theory before starting a project. Build, then come back with questions.

## Quick start

```sh
npm install
npm run docs:dev        # dev server with hot reload
npm run docs:build      # production build
npm run docs:preview    # preview built site
```

To refresh the README screenshots after a build:

```sh
npm run docs:build
npm run screenshots:readme
