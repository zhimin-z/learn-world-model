## The Model Is Smart, The Harness Makes It Reliable

There's a hard truth most people learn the hard way: **the strongest model in the world will still fail on real engineering tasks if you don't build a proper environment around it.**

You've probably seen this yourself. You give Claude or GPT a task in your repo. It starts well — reads files, writes code, looks productive. Then something goes wrong. It skips a step. It breaks a test. It says "done" but nothing actually works. You spend more time cleaning up than if you'd done it yourself.

This isn't a model problem. It's a harness problem.

The evidence is clear. Anthropic ran a controlled experiment: same model (Opus 4.5), same prompt ("build a 2D retro game editor"). Without a harness, it spent $9 in 20 minutes and produced something that didn't work. With a full harness (planner + generator + evaluator), it spent $200 in 6 hours and built a game you could actually play. The model didn't change. The harness did.

OpenAI reported the same thing with Codex: in a well-harnessed repository, the same model goes from "unreliable" to "reliable." Not a marginal improvement — a qualitative shift.

**This course teaches you how to build that environment.**

```text
                    THE HARNESS PATTERN
                    ====================

    You --> give task --> Agent reads harness files --> Agent executes
                                                        |
                                              harness governs every step:
                                              |
                                              +--> Instructions: what to do, in what order
                                              +--> Scope:       one feature at a time, no overreach
                                              +--> State:       progress log, feature list, git history
                                              +--> Verification: tests, lint, type-check, smoke runs
                                              +--> Lifecycle:   init at start, clean state at end
                                              |
                                              v
                                         Agent stops only when
                                         verification passes
```

## What Harness Engineering Actually Means

Harness engineering is about building a complete working environment around the model so it produces reliable results. It's not about writing better prompts. It's about designing the system the model operates inside.

A harness has five subsystems:

```text
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                        THE HARNESS                              │
    │                                                                 │

    │   │ AGENTS.md    │  │ progress.md  │  │ tests + lint         │ │
    │   │ CLAUDE.md    │  │ feature_list │  │ type-check           │ │
    │   │ feature_list │  │ git log      │  │ smoke runs           │ │
    │   │ docs/        │  │ session hand │  │ e2e pipeline         │ │
    │   └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └──────────────────────┘ │
    │                                                                 │
    │   ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐   │
    │   │    Scope     │  │         Session Lifecycle             │   │
    │   │              │  │                                      │   │
    │   │ one feature  │  │ init.sh at start                     │   │
    │   │ at a time   │  │ clean-state checklist at end          │   │
    │   │ definition   │  │ handoff note for next session        │   │
    │   │ of done      │  │ commit only when safe to resume      │   │
    │   └──────────────┘  └──────────────────────────────────────┘   │
    │                                                                 │
    └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

    The MODEL decides what code to write.
    The HARNESS governs when, where, and how it writes it.
    The harness doesn't make the model smarter.
    It makes the model's output reliable.
```

Each subsystem has one job:

- **Instructions** — Tell the agent what to do, in what order, and what to read before starting. Not one giant file; a progressive disclosure structure the agent navigates on demand.
- **State** — Track what's been done, what's in progress, and what's next. Persisted to disk so the next session picks up exactly where the last one left off.
- **Verification** — Only a passing test suite counts as evidence. The agent cannot declare victory without runnable proof.
- **Scope** — Constrain the agent to one feature at a time. No overreach. No half-finishing three things. No rewriting the feature list to hide unfinished work.
- **Session Lifecycle** — Initialize at the start. Clean up at the end. Leave a clean restart path for the next session.

---

## Why This Course Exists

The question isn't "can models write code?" They can. The question is: **can they reliably complete real engineering tasks inside real repositories, over multiple sessions, without constant human supervision?**

Right now, the answer is: not without a harness.

```text
    WITHOUT HARNESS                          WITH HARNESS
    ==============                          ============

    Session 1: agent writes code            Session 1: agent reads instructions
              agent breaks tests                      agent runs init.sh
              agent says "done"                       agent works on one feature
              you fix it manually                     agent verifies before claiming done
                                                       agent updates progress log
    Session 2: agent starts fresh                    agent commits clean state
              agent has no memory
              of what happened before         Session 2: agent reads progress log
              agent re-does work                       agent picks up exactly where it left off
              or does something else entirely          agent continues the unfinished feature
              you fix it again                         you review, not rescue

    Result: you spend more time                  Result: agent does the work,
            cleaning up than if you                      you verify the result
            did it yourself
```

The questions this course actually cares about:

- Which harness designs improve task completion rates?
- Which designs reduce rework and incorrect completions?
- Which mechanisms keep long-running tasks progressing steadily?
- Which structures keep the system maintainable after multiple agent runs?

## Course Curriculum & Documentation

For the full course materials, please visit the **[Documentation Website](https://walkinglabs.github.io/learn-harness-engineering/)**.

The curriculum is divided into three parts:

1. **Lectures**: 12 conceptual units explaining the theory behind harness engineering.
2. **Projects**: 6 hands-on projects where you build an agentic workspace from scratch.
3. **Resource Library**: Copy-ready templates (`AGENTS.md`, `feature_list.json`, `init.sh`, etc.) to use in your own repositories today.

---

## Quick Start: Improve Your Agent Today

You don't need to read all 12 lectures before you start getting value. If you're already using a coding agent on a real project, here's how to improve it right now.

The idea is simple: instead of just writing prompts, give your agent a set of structured files that define what to do, what's been done, and how to verify the work. These files live inside your repo, so every session starts from the same state.

```text
    YOUR PROJECT ROOT
    ├── AGENTS.md              <-- the agent's operating manual
    ├── CLAUDE.md              <-- (alternative, if using Claude Code)
    ├── init.sh                <-- runs install + verify + start
    ├── feature_list.json      <-- what features exist, which are done
    ├── claude-progress.md     <-- what happened each session
    └── src/                   <-- your actual code
```

Grab the starter templates from the [Resource Library](https://walkinglabs.github.io/learn-harness-engineering/en/resources/) and drop them into your project. That's it. Four files, and your agent sessions will already be significantly more stable than running on prompts alone.

## Capstone Project: A Real App

All six course projects revolve around the same product: **an Electron-based personal knowledge base desktop app**.

    Core features:
    ├── Import local documents
    ├── Manage a document library
    ├── Process and index documents
    ├── Run AI-powered Q&A over imported content
    └── Return grounded answers with citations
```

This project was chosen because it combines strong practical value, enough real-world product complexity, and a good setting for observing before/after harness improvements.

Each course project's starter/solution is a complete copy of this Electron app at that evolutionary stage. P(N+1)'s starter is derived from P(N)'s solution — the app evolves as your harness skills grow.

## The Agent Session Lifecycle

One of the core ideas in this course: **the agent's session should follow a structured lifecycle, not a free-for-all.** Here's what that looks like:

```text
    AGENT SESSION LIFECYCLE
    ======================

    ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  START                                                          │
    │                                                                  │
    │  1. Agent reads AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md                           │
    │  2. Agent runs init.sh (install, verify, health check)          │
    │  3. Agent reads claude-progress.md (what happened last time)    │

    The harness governs every transition in this lifecycle.
    The model decides what code to write at each step.
    Without the harness, step 9 becomes "agent says it looks fine."
    With the harness, step 9 is "tests pass, lint is clean, types check."

## Who This Is For

This course is for:

- Engineers already using coding agents who want better stability and quality
- Researchers or builders who want a systematic understanding of harness design
- Tech leads who need to understand how environment design affects agent performance

This course is not for:

- People looking for a zero-code AI introduction
- People who only care about prompts and don't plan to build real implementations
- Learners not prepared to let agents work inside real repositories

---

## Requirements

This is a course where you actually run coding agents.

You need at least one of these tools:

- Claude Code
- Codex
- Another IDE or CLI coding agent that supports file editing, command execution, and multi-step tasks

The course assumes you can:

- Open a local repository
- Allow the agent to edit files
- Allow the agent to run commands
- Inspect output and re-run tasks

If you don't have such a tool, you can still read the course content, but you won't be able to complete the projects as intended.

---

## Local Preview

This repository uses VitePress as a documentation viewer.

```sh
npm install
npm run docs:dev        # Dev server with hot reload
npm run docs:build      # Production build
npm run docs:preview    # Preview built site
```

Then open the local URL that VitePress outputs in your browser.

---

## Prerequisites

Required:

- Familiarity with the terminal, git, and local development environments
- Ability to read and write code in at least one common application stack
- Basic software debugging experience (reading logs, tests, and runtime behavior)
- Enough time to commit to implementation-focused coursework

Helpful but not required:

- Experience with Electron, desktop apps, or local-first tools
- Background in testing, logging, or software architecture
- Prior exposure to Codex, Claude Code, or similar coding agents

## How the Course Is Organized

- Each lecture focuses on one question
- The course includes 6 projects
- Every project requires the agent to do real work
- Every project compares weak vs. strong harness results
- What matters is the measured difference, not how many docs were written

---

## Skills

This repository also includes reusable AI agent skills that you can install directly into your IDE or agent workspace.

- [**harness-creator**](./skills/harness-creator/): A skill that helps you scaffold a production-grade harness for your own project in minutes.
