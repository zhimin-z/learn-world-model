# Welcome to Learn Harness Engineering

Learn Harness Engineering is a course dedicated to the engineering of AI coding agents. We have deeply studied and synthesized the most advanced Harness Engineering theories and practices in the industry. Our core references include:
- [OpenAI: Harness engineering: leveraging Codex in an agent-first world](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/)
- [Anthropic: Effective harnesses for long-running agents](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-harnesses-for-long-running-agents)
- [Anthropic: Harness design for long-running application development](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/harness-design-long-running-apps)
- [Awesome Harness Engineering](https://github.com/walkinglabs/awesome-harness-engineering)

Through systematic environment design, state management, verification, and control systems, this course teaches you how to make agentic coding tools like Codex and Claude Code truly reliable. It helps you build features, fix bugs, and automate development tasks by constraining your AI coding assistant with explicit rules and boundaries.

## The Core Mechanism of a Harness

A harness doesn't "make the model smarter"; rather, it establishes a closed-loop **working system** for the model. You can understand its core workflow through this simple diagram:

## What you will learn

Here are some of the key concepts you will master:

<ul class="index-list">
  <li><strong>Constrain agent behavior</strong> with explicit rules and boundaries.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain context</strong> across long-running, multi-session tasks.</li>
  <li><strong>Stop agents</strong> from declaring victory too early.</li>
  <li><strong>Verify work</strong> using full-pipeline tests and self-reflection.</li>
  <li><strong>Make runtime observable</strong> and debuggable.</li>
</ul>
